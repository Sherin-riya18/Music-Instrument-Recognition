# Music-Instrument-Recognition

This project implements a deep learning-based music instrument recognition system developed in Google Colab using PyTorch and Librosa. It takes audio clips as input, converts them into Mel-spectrograms, and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet18 or a custom model) to classify the audio into different musical instrument categories such as piano, guitar, violin, etc. The model is trained and evaluated using standard classification metrics, and the workflow includes all steps from audio preprocessing to model training and performance visualization. This project serves as a practical application of audio signal processing and neural networks for real-world sound classification tasks.
